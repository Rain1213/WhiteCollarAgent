name: This is an example of a task document.
description: Task document provides agent a 'best approach' method for executing a task during planning

goal/outcome:
  - This section states the goal/outcome of this task.
  - The outcome can be action committed, files created, user requirement acheived, user approval.
  - The goal/outcome need to be concrete, detail, specific and validatable. It cannot be generic and vague
  - The amount of goal/outcome stated here need to match the complexity of the task.

inputs_params:
  - This section states the resources and information needed for completing the task.
  - The input params can be user's information, preference, they way they want their tasks to be done.
  - There are input params that is definately required, a roadblocker to the task.
  - There are also input params that are optional and good to have, but the agent can decide themself if the user did not or refuse to provide the information.

context:
    reasoning:
      - Reasoning of what to do to achieve the goal
      - Reasoning of how to achieve the highest standard of completing the task
      - Enough reasoning steps to cover most of the cases
    deadline: {time remaining} left until deadline {deadline in absolute time format}
    definition_of_done(check during final validation step):
      - Qualitative and quantitative metrics of the outcome
      - Outcome with the highest standard
      - Items required for the task to be considered done
      - Invalid items do not appear as outcome
      - Items that can be validated
    avoid:
      - Items to avoid in the outcome
      - Possible sub-standard outcome

steps:
    name: Step name in the format of Verb then Object (the first step).
    description: The detail and concrete description of the step stating the outcome, input/condition required, and method of this step.
    action_instruction: A detail paragraph of the actions needed in sequence, their input parameters and their expected outcome with hyper-detail information with enough actions covering the step.
    validation_instruction: A detail paragraph of the validation actions needed in sequence, their input parameters and their definition of done of the previous actions with hyper-detail information. Optional if the step is easy and has nothing to be validated.

    name: Step name in the format of Verb then Object (the second step).
    description: The detail and concrete description of the step stating the outcome, input/condition required, and method of this step.
    action_instruction: A detail paragraph of the actions needed in sequence, their input parameters and their expected outcome with hyper-detail information with enough actions covering the step.
    validation_instruction: A detail paragraph of the validation actions needed in sequence, their input parameters and their definition of done of the previous actions with hyper-detail information. Optional if the step is easy and has nothing to be validated.

    ...

    name: Step name in the format of Verb then Object (the nth step).
    description: The detail and concrete description of the step stating the outcome, input/condition required, and method of this step.
    action_instruction: A detail paragraph of the actions needed in sequence, their input parameters and their expected outcome with hyper-detail information with enough actions covering the step.
    validation_instruction: A detail paragraph of the validation actions needed in sequence, their input parameters and their definition of done of the previous actions with hyper-detail information. Optional if the step is easy and has nothing to be validated.

    name: Overall validation step name in the format of Verb then Object (the final validation step).
    description: The detail and concrete description of the step stating the outcome, input/condition required, and method of this step.
    action_instruction: A detail paragraph of the actions needed in sequence, their input parameters and their expected outcome with hyper-detail information with enough actions covering the step.
    
    name: Closing step (the last step).
    description: The last step that let the agent to report the outcome of this task to the users (e.g., report finding, report changes made, deliver attachments created.), perform clean up action (e.g., delete temp files, close browser session), create proactive tasks or update the proactive goal journal if this is a proactive task ,and lastly the agent MUST perform a mark task (e.g., mark task completed, mark task cancel, mask task error) done action to close this task.
    action_instruction: A detail paragraph of the actions needed in sequence, it usually involved 'send user message', 'send user message with attachments', 'update proactive goal journal', 'mark task completed', 'mark task cancel', 'mask task error'.
